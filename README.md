*Final Project for CSC 112 - Programming Language*<br>
## Colang
A custom programming language which have taken inspiration from a bunch of other languages and trying to get that minimalist look!

The language supports int and char declaration via 'nmbr' and 'chr' repsectively and keyword 'flex' for dynamic data typing because why not!

## Syntax
~~~
nmbr -> equivalent to saying int with the same capabilities
chr  ->  equivalent to char 
flex -> basically a new data type that auto detects during run time what type it, it can be a nmbr or a chr 

e.g
nmbr a : 12
chr b : 'A'
flex c : 33
flex d : 'A'

shw -> printing function in which if you declared shw then a string literal or a variable 

e.g 
shw x 

assuming x is a variable declared it will then show the value of x

for concactenation we can use '.'

e.g
nmbr x : 10
shw "hello! I'm ".x." years old!"

It is that simple!
