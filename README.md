*Final Project for CSC 112 - Programming Language*<br>

A custom programming language which have taken inspiration from a bunch of other languages and trying to get that minimalist look!

The language supports int and char declaration via 'nmbr' and 'chr' repsectively and keyword 'flex' for dynamic data typing because why not!
