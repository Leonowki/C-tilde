*Final Project for CSC 112 - Programming Language*<br>
## C~
A C variant programming language that uses '~' as the closing for each line hence the C~ naming.

The language supports int and char declaration via 'nmbr' and 'chr' repsectively and keyword 'flex' for dynamic data typing because why not!
